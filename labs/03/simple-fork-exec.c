/**************************

The fork call basically makes a duplicate of the current process,
identical in almost every way

The new process (child) gets a different process ID (PID) and has the the
PID of the old process (parent) as its parent PID (PPID). Because the two
processes are now running exactly the same code, they can tell which is which
by the return code of fork:

	The child gets 0
	The parent gets the PID of the child.

The exec call is a way to basically replace the entire current process with a
new program. It loads the program into the current process space and runs it
from the entry point.

IE:

+--------+
| pid=7  |
| ppid=4 |
| bash   |
+--------+
    |
    | calls fork
    V
+--------+             +--------+
| pid=7  |    forks    | pid=22 |
| ppid=4 | ----------> | ppid=7 |
| bash   |             | bash   |
+--------+             +--------+
    |                      |
    | waits for pid 22     | calls exec to run ls
    |                      V
    |                  +--------+
    |                  | pid=22 |
    |                  | ppid=7 |
    |                  | ls     |
    V                  +--------+
+--------+                 |
| pid=7  |                 | exits
| ppid=4 | <---------------+
| bash   |
+--------+
    |
    | continues
    V
